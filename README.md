# Pro-Tasker / MERN Capstone 

A full-stack project management application with **authentication, responsive dashboard, and task tracking**. Users can create projects, add/edit/delete tasks, and manage priorities and statuses in a clean UI.  

## Application Function
Pro-Tasker, your personal project and task management dashboard.  

Pro-Tasker helps you:  
- Create and manage projects  
- Add, edit, and track tasks within each project  
- Stay organized with priorities, statuses, and deadlines  
- Update progress seamlessly and keep everything in sync 

I built Pro-Tasker as a capstone project to showcase full-stack development skills. Itâ€™s designed to give users a clean and responsive interface to manage their work efficiently.  
You can create projects, assign tasks with priority levels, and mark progress with status badges. Once done, tasks or projects can be updated or deleted easily.
